One <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2017/10/26/the-problematic-past-of-contemporary-civilization/">article in the opinion section by Tommy Song</a> criticized the Core for its origin in “Woodrow Wilson’s doctrines of intervention and anti-isolationism for the sake of capitalism and democracy, solidifying the belief that the West must decide the fate of other states and peoples”, as well as its acceptance of the “Eurocentric canons and practices, keeping the same ugly form that was established when Columbia was, as University President Butler declared 111 years ago, a ‘Christian institution.’” While another <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2018/12/19/lets-talk-about-cc/">opinion article</a> by Emmanuelle Saada, Chair of Contemporary Civilization, stated that the effort to change the pedagogical significance of Contemporary Civilization is reflected in the inclusion of “texts that explore and challenge assumptions about a ‘European tradition,’” these additions are also criticized by Tommy as feeling “tacked-on and last-minute.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In my personal experience, I have learned a ton about how the discourses of the authors we read shaped our world, sometimes in very horrifying ways. We observed patterns in arguments made by different authors that established a foundation for practices in the world right now, and we also discovered the dependency of these works upon each other through reading the citations. Thus, I envisioned to capture these patterns in rhetorics and intertextual connections while also building a tool for more people to access and assess the CC curriculum for themselves. </p> <p class="g-body subhed">How to compute?</p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In this project, I explored the CC curriculum through computing and visualizing a collection of 16 texts (<i>The Republic</i>, <i>Politics</i>, <i>The Bible</i>, <i>The City of God, Volume I, Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences</i>, <i>Leviathan, Second Treatise of Government</i>, <i>The Social Contract and Discourses</i>, <i>Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals</i>, <i>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke</i>, <i>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>, <i>Democracy in America</i>, <i>On Liberty</i>, <i>A Contribution to The Critique Of The Political Economy, On the Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection</i>) by 15 authors (Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Descartes, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant, Smith, Burke, Wollstonecraft, Tocqueville, Mill, Marx, and Darwin). </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> My first approach is to capture the discourse among these authors through observing their citational practices. I started out with obtaining these texts from Project Gutenberg, which provides digital forms of these texts for free. I then counted the occurrence of names of the other authors for each text, which produced a matrix. From the matrix, I developed this chord diagram which sketches the citation of other writers by the arcs. Each directed arc represents citation by one author of another author, and the width of the arc is scaled by the number of times a particular citation occurs. </p> <div class="graphic"> <div class="chord-chart"> </div> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> There are several observations I made: </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> * The sheer amount of Plato content in Augustine? </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> * There are many links between different authors, which shows that each piece of the circumference representing the authors are very interconnected. This raises the question of whether some ideas in CC curriculum are self-contained, and if so what does the canon really represent? </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> * While this chart seems messy, it is missing a lot of information in terms of how this interconnectedness impacts the ideas and arguments of each author. And we need to look deeper into the actual text for that. </p> <div class="graphic"> <div class="buttons"> <span>india</span> <span>colony</span> <span>savage</span> <span>slave</span> <span>universal</span> <span>women</span> <span>civilization</span> </div> <div class="word-tree-container"> <div class="arc-chart"></div> <div class="word-tree"></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="footer g-body"> <div class="article-credits"> <p> Produced with <a href="https://github.com/graphicsdesk/spectate">Spectate</a> by the <a href="https://graphicsdesk.github.io">Spectator Graphics</a> team. </p> </div> </div> <script src="script.75da7f30.js"></script> </body></html>
